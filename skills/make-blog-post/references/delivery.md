# Delivery

How to shape the post for where it is going. The content is the same everywhere; only the wrapping changes.

## Chat

When no file is written, the reply is the deliverable, so it has to survive one copy with no cleanup.

- **One fenced block.** The post contains its own three-backtick fences, so fence the outer block with four backticks.
- **Nothing interleaved.** Do not split the post across several blocks with commentary between them. Notes go after the block.
- **Front matter only if the target parses it.** For a hosted editor, a venue with no front matter, or a target that is still unknown, deliver the shape in **Venues with no front matter** instead.
- **List the metadata after the block.** When the block carries no front matter, or the target has its own title, description, or tag fields, list the title, description, slug, and tags after the block so nothing is lost. Leave the tags out only when the target is known to have nowhere to put them.
- **No file.** Do not save a copy unless asked. Offer one in a single line.

## Venues with no front matter

A gist, a Discussions post, a wiki page, or a snippet on a hosted git service publishes a standalone, readable page without being a blog: there is no generator, no front matter, and no feed.

- **Never leave a front matter block at the top.** A venue that does not parse it shows the raw `title:` and `description:` lines as body text.
- **The title becomes the first heading**, or the venue's own title field where it has one.
- **The description becomes the opening line** of the body, or the venue's description field.
- **Tags have nowhere to live.** Drop them, or work the one or two that matter into the opening sentence as ordinary words.

### Example: a gist

A gist has two pieces of discoverable text and no front matter at all.

- **Gist description**: carries the post description. It is the line readers see in listings and search results, so it holds the primary search phrase. One sentence, no project details.
- **File name**: carries the slug and sets syntax highlighting. `slugify-text.md` renders as Markdown and keeps the primary phrase in the URL.
- **File body**: an `H1` matching the title, then the walkthrough.

Keep it to one file. A gist with several files reads as a project, not a post.

## Hosted platforms

When the user posts by hand to a hosted blog platform or any account-bound site, only the user can reach the final venue.

- **Shape the post for that platform.** Some accept a front matter block on paste; most do not.
- **Stage a file only at a path the user named.** A venue name, such as a platform, publication, or account, is never a path. Without a named path, deliver in chat.
- **Follow the post with a hand-off summary**: the venue, the file written if any, and the title, description, slug, and tags, with the field each one goes in.
- **Name any manual step that remains**, such as clearing a draft flag, choosing a canonical URL, or picking tags from a fixed list.

## Never

Do not create the gist, open the discussion, edit the wiki, upload, post, commit, or push. Each is a separate action that needs its own request from the user.
